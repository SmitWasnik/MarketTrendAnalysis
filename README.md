# Linear Regression Prediction Model

This project implements a **Linear Regression Model** to make predictions based on input data.  
It was developed and tested in **Google Colab**, and the code is now hosted on GitHub.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Uses **Linear Regression** for prediction tasks.  
- Built in **Python**.  
- Runs on **Google Colab** and can also run locally.  
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Data is preprocessed and cleaned.  
2. The **Linear Regression model** from `sklearn.linear_model` is trained on the dataset.  
3. The model makes predictions for given inputs.

## 🚀 Running the Code

### Option 1: Run in Google Colab
1. Upload the notebook to Colab.  
2. Run all cells step by step.  
3. The trained model will generate predictions.

### Option 2: Run Locally (Windows)
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SmitWasnik/MarketTrendAnalysis.git
   cd MarketTrendAnalysis
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Python script or notebook.

## 📊 Example Output
After training, the model predicts values for the given input dataset. Example:

```
Input: [X values]
Predicted Output: [Y values]
```
